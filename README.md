# COMP-SCI-7138-assignment-2

The purpose of this assessment is to build and test different convolution neural network (CNN) to build classifier on image data. The dataset that I used is the popular CIFAR10 dataset. I experimented various aspect of CNN model (different architectures of CNN, in particular, the depth of the CNN networks), batch normalization, activation function, etc.) to see how each aspect can help improve the model performance.
